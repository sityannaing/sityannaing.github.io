            <h1>Early life and education</h1>
            <p>Bieber was born on March 1, 1994, at St Joseph's Hospital in London, Ontario,and was raised in Stratford, Ontario.He is the son of Jeremy Jack Bieber and Pattie Mallette, who were never married.Mallette's mother Diane and stepfather Bruce helped her raise her son.Bieber's ancestry includes French-Canadian, Irish, English, Scottish, and German.
    
                Through his father, Jeremy, Bieber has three younger half-siblings. Jeremy and his ex-wife, Erin Wagner,who broke up in 2014 after seven years together, have two children, daughter Jazmyn and son Jaxon.Jeremy married his girlfriend Chelsey in February 2018, and they have a daughter named Bay.Bieber also has a stepsister named Allie, the daughter of his stepmother.Pattie worked a series of low-paying office jobs, raising Bieber as a single mother in low-income housing. Bieber has maintained contact with his father.
                
                Bieber attended a French-language immersion elementary school in Stratford, the Jeanne Sauv√© Catholic School.He graduated from high school in Stratford, Ontario, the St. Michael Catholic Secondary School, in 2012 with a 4.0 GPA.Growing up, he learned to play the piano, drums, guitar, and trumpet.In early 2007, aged 12, Bieber sang Ne-Yo's "So Sick" for a local singing competition in Stratford and was placed second.Mallette posted a video of the performance on YouTube for their family and friends to see. She continued to upload videos of Bieber singing covers of various R&B songs, and Bieber's popularity on the site grew.In the same year, Bieber busked shows in front of Avon Theatre steps with a rented guitar during tourism season.</p>

            <h1>Career</h1>
            <p>While searching for videos of a different singer, Scooter Braun, a former marketing executive of So So Def Recordings, clicked on one of Bieber's 2007 YouTube videos by accident.Impressed, Braun tracked down the theatre Bieber was performing at, located Bieber's school, and finally contacted his mother Mallette, who was initially reluctant because of Braun's Judaism. She remembered praying, "God, I gave him to you. You could send me a Christian man, a Christian label!", and, "God, you don't want this Jewish kid to be Justin's man, do you?" However, church elders convinced her to let Bieber go with Braun. At age 13, Bieber went to Atlanta, Georgia, with Braun to record demo tapes.Bieber began singing for Usher one week later.
    
                Bieber was soon signed to Raymond Braun Media Group (RBMG), a joint venture between Braun and Usher.Justin Timberlake was reportedly also in the running to sign Bieber but lost the bidding war to Usher, partly due to the idea that two associated Justins would confuse the market.
                
                Usher then sought assistance in finding a label home for the artist from then manager Chris Hicks, who helped engineer an audition with his contact L.A. Reid of The Island Def Jam Music Group. Reid signed Bieber to Island Records in October 2008 (resulting in a joint venture between RBMG and Island Records) and appointed Hicks as executive vice-president of Def Jam, where he could manage Bieber's career at the label.Bieber then moved to Atlanta with his mother to pursue further work with Braun and Usher.Braun became Bieber's manager in 2008.</p>
